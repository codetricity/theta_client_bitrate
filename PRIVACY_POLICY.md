# THETA Client Bitrate Privacy Policy

This app is released under the MIT license. It is an example
of using bitrate to manage the clarity and file size of still
images.

The app connects to a 360 camera using WiFi.  I have only
tested it with RICOH THETA camera.  There should be no
Internet connection for the app and thus no way to collect
any information.

This app relies on theta-client.

I've only tested the app in Access Point mode, which means that the
camera is the hotspot. Modifications of this app theoretically
could connect to the Internet.  However, the app in this
repository does not connect to the Internet.
